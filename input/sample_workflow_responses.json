    "response": "The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest.\n\nMount Everest is located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and Tibet (China). Its peak is 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) above sea level, making it the highest point on Earth.\n\nSome key facts about Mount Everest:\n\n- Height: 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) above sea level\n- First summited in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\n- Part of the Himalayas mountain range on the border of Nepal and Tibet (China)\n- One of the \"Seven Summits\" - the highest peaks on each of the world's seven continents\n- Known for its extremely challenging and dangerous climbing conditions due to high altitude, extreme weather, and technical difficulty\n\nSo in summary, the tallest mountain in the world is the iconic Mount Everest, located in the Himalayan mountains on the Nepal-Tibet border."
